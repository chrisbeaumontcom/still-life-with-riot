          <p>2021 is off and racing... and started with a riot!</p>

          <p>
            Would there have been a riot at the US Capitol on the 6th January
            2021 without social media?
          </p>

          <p>
            This work is about time. Present time, historical time and the way
            time just seems to race at us. Unlike photographs which are records
            of an instant, paintings are painted over time. Both are images but
            paintings really are things, and the recording they make is of their
            own execution. This painting is an effort at History painting - even
            if it is a still life.
          </p>

          <p>
            This one is the third in a series of three identical still life
            arrangements of lemons on a marble ledge. The first has an entirely
            black background with hints of geometry. The second has a colourful
            geometric field as a background. This third one jumps the shark
            (relatively) into history and was originally painted as a grisaille
            with no reference to riots. That version is now history because I
            have completely over-painted it in glorious technicolor including a
            social media driven riot that will certainly go down in US and world
            history.
          </p>
          <p>The original series:</p>

              src="/images/lemons-x3-2017.jpg"
              alt="3 paintings of lemons"
              width={800}
              height={210}
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            I wanted to play with the performance of an oil painting like a
            composer creating variations on a theme or a musician performing the
            same piece multiple times. I set out to take a previous composition
            and execute/perform it in three variations: the same still life
            subject arrangement with three completely different visual contexts.
          </p>

          <p>
            This picture uses the (very melbourne) neo-classical architecture in
            the upper left of Tiepolo's <em>The Banquet of Cleopatra</em>, a
            painting about an historical moment. When I saw the images on social
            media of the US Capitol riots of 6 January I knew I had to re-paint
            Tieplo's balconies. They had changed role from passive witness to
            active insurrection.
          </p>

          <p>
            History is a race to what happened next. The horse and jockey is
            borrowed from a past commission and surrealistically challenges the
            stasis of the still life of lemons. It is racing across the the
            canvas yet frozen in a photographic moment of history.
